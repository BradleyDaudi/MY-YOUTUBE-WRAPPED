📺 Personal YouTube Watch History Analysis

A reflective deep dive into my most-watched YouTube channels, powered by my own data

🎯 Purpose

This project was born from curiosity — I wanted to better understand my own content consumption habits on YouTube. Using the YouTube API, I scraped and analyzed my personal watch history to identify the channels and creators I engage with the most. The goal wasn’t just to look at raw numbers, but to find patterns and insights that reflect who I am, what I value, and how I spend my digital time.

🛠️ How I Did It

I accessed my YouTube data using the YouTube Data API, which allowed me to extract a detailed list of my watch history. I then cleaned and reviewed this data to identify the most watched channels, and took a qualitative approach to understand why these creators stood out to me.

🗂️ What I Discovered

Here’s a breakdown of the kinds of content that rose to the top:
	•	🎤 Music & Vibes
Artists like Fireboy DML, Sauti Sol, Zerb, Young John, and Victony dominated my watch history — clear proof of my love for Afrobeat, soulful fusion, and cross-cultural rhythm.
	•	🧠 Interviews & Stories that Matter
Channels like Lynn Ngugi Network (LNN), CTA (Cleaning the Airwaves), Dialogue with Jagero, and UpSyd consistently kept me engaged through powerful storytelling and real-life interviews.
	•	💡 Learning & Tech
Practical knowledge is a huge part of my YouTube time — from Power BI tutorials to iDeviceHelp, I frequently turn to the platform to solve tech issues and upskill.
	•	🏡 Finance & Real Estate
Channels like Wealth Tribe by Agatha and Priter Homes Real Estate reveal my growing interest in money matters, investments, and property — key themes for long-term growth.
	•	🎭 Culture, Faith & Humor
From the gospel roots of Esther Wahome and Jemmimah Thiong’o, to the comedic genius of Awinja (Disco Matanga), my taste spans tradition, spirituality, and fun.

🔍 Key Insight

This wasn’t just about watching habits — it was about personal discovery.
By analyzing my own YouTube data, I saw how my interests are shaped by African culture, music, storytelling, self-improvement, and curiosity. I’m drawn to content that is authentic, relatable, and rich in perspective — whether that’s in a beat, a story, or a tutorial.

🧾 Next Step

The insights gathered here lay the foundation for a visual presentation and deeper content curation. This could serve as a personal digital fingerprint — or even a springboard for content I might want to create, follow up on, or recommend to others.
