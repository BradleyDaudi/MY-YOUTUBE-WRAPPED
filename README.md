🎯 Purpose

This project began as a way to better understand my own content consumption habits. Over time, I noticed recurring patterns in the types of creators and themes I enjoy most on YouTube. This analysis captures the essence of that journey — what I watch, why I watch it, and how it reflects my personal interests and values.

🧠 Approach

By casually reviewing my YouTube watch patterns over a long period, I created a shortlist of creators and content types that consistently stood out. This wasn’t about deep data analytics — just observation and reflection on the content that continues to draw me in.
