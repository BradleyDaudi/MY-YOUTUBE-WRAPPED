📺 Personal YouTube Watch History Analysis

A reflective overview of my most-watched creators and content themes on YouTube

🎯 Purpose

This project started as a personal curiosity,  I wanted to better understand the kind of content I gravitate toward on YouTube. Over time, I began noticing patterns in what I consistently watch and decided to take a step back to document the most influential channels and creators in my viewing journey.

🧠 Approach

By reviewing my own YouTube viewing trends over time, I compiled a list of creators and topics that have left a lasting impression, whether through entertainment, inspiration, or education. This analysis isn’t just about content, it’s about what resonates with me and why.

🗂️ Key Discoveries
	•	🎤 Music That Moves Me
From Sauti Sol to Fireboy DML, Young John, Zerb, and Victony, my love for Afrobeats, soulful rhythms, and genre-bending collaborations is clear. These artists have dominated my playlists with catchy hooks and meaningful lyrics.
	•	🧠 Conversations That Stick
Channels like Lynn Ngugi Network, CTA (Cleaning the Airwaves), UpSyd, and Dialogue with Jagero deliver powerful interviews and untold stories that stay with me long after I’ve watched them.
	•	💡 Learning Moments
Whether it’s a tech tutorial, a walkthrough on business tools, or troubleshooting tips, I find myself often drawn to channels that make complex topics easier to understand, like How to Power BI or iDeviceHelp.
	•	🏠 Lifestyle & Growth
Real estate, financial education, and career content from creators like Priter Homes and Wealth Tribe by Agatha show my interest in long-term personal growth, investment, and informed decision-making.
	•	🎭 Culture, Humor & Faith
From the nostalgic gospel tunes of Esther Wahome and Jemmimah Thiong’o, to the vibrant humor of Awinja (Disco Matanga), my watchlist reflects a strong connection to culture, identity, and joy.

🧾 Reflection

Looking at my viewing habits through this lens helped me recognize recurring themes in what I value: authenticity, storytelling, self-improvement, and cultural pride. YouTube, for me, isn’t just entertainment — it’s a space of learning, identity, and inspiration.
